I currently work at the [National and Kapodistrian University of Athens](https://www.di.uoa.gr/en) and [Archimedes/Athena RC](https://archimedesai.gr/en/), focusing on theory-based Machine Learning models.

Previously, I conducted research at [DTU](https://www.compute.dtu.dk/) and [CTU in Prague](https://fel.cvut.cz/en) in the field of Optimization, and at the [Athena RC](https://www.athenarc.gr/en/imsi) and [Max Planck Institute](https://www.mis.mpg.de/), where I specialized in Natural Language Processing.

I also have a solid statistical and mathematical background acquired through master's and bachelor's studies at the [University of Oxford](https://www.stats.ox.ac.uk/) and [University of Patras](https://www.math.upatras.gr/en). I aim to continue expanding my knowledge and pursue a research career.

I was lucky to grow up in the village of Agioi Pantes on [Zakynthos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zakynthos), an island in Greece; a place full of natural beauty and history.
